### Loop Exercises


	1. Using a For loop, generate the following output from 1 to 10: 

#### Output	


```sh
Number[1] 

...

Number[10]
```


	2. Using a While loop, generate the same output as the first exercise.


	3. Using a Do-While, generate the same output as the first exercise.


Create a new branch called "Loop-Exercises", and make a single commit for each exercise.


### Char concatenation


 Ask the user for three int inputs. Once you get the values from the inputs, generate the following output (Assuming value 1 = 2, value 2 = 4, value 3 = 8 ):


#### Output:

 
```sh
--*

----*

--------*
```	


For this exercise, make a commit called "Char Concatenation" in the same branch (Loop-Exercises). Once the commit is done, create a new pull request for the branch.
